This repository contains my Virtual AI desktop assistant project named Jarvis which is basically a desktop assistant which can perform multiple tasks through speech recognition.
The various operations include sending/receiving eamils, opening and playing youtube and music , solving queries using google , performing calculations , opening different applications.
Jarvis can also tell jokes.
